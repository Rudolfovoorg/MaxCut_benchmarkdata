# MaxCut_benchmark_data
This site contains:
- the benchmark dataset of Billionnet and Elloumi (be),
- the Beasley benchmark dataset (bqp)
- and the G dataset, created by Helmberg and Rendl (yyye).

For each instance, we provide the original matrix for the Max-Cut formulation of the problem, the Laplacian matrix, the corresponding python dictionary, the optimum or a best-known cut, and the optimum or the best-known value. 
Beside this, we provide also the sample of python script that can be used to submit data instances to D-Wave solvers, and the code qp2mc, that we used to transform original QUBO problems into instances of the Max-Cut problens for the be and bqp datasets.
